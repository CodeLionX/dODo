## Feedback and notes to our approaches

- define protocols for different aspects of the algorithm (e.g. work stealing): those protocols can influence each other, so think ahead and talk through them with Thorsten
- data replication: copy dataset to all nodes
  - send batches of records with standard messaging and let subsystem do the serialization etc.
  - side channel: actor with HTTP interface to query for the big data (uses a stable connection with acknowledgements)
- mid-term presentation
  - have a slide to describe how to fix the approach, what is wrong, etc.
  - decide for topic to present in the mid-term:
    - findings in akka
    - raw architecture
    - problems we faced
    - anecdotes and findings
  - audience: they think about using akka and also work on problems: what could be interesting for them?
