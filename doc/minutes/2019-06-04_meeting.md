| Status | Who?  | Until when?   | What? |
| :----: | :---: | :------------ | :---- |
| :heavy_check_mark: | Jul | 01.06. | Batch work and results for workers inside the actor systems to reduce message load on master actor |
| :heavy_check_mark: | Sebi | 01.06. | Side-channel for data set exchange between actor systems (using Netty) |

## Result Collector

- new idea: use [Akka distriubted data module](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/distributed-data.html) to store received results replicated across nodes
- use write majority to ensure that we are fail-save
- this frees us from using Akka persistence (and setting up a external journal store, e.g. Cassandra)

## Idea: Use Akka PubSub for master state replication

- we decided against using [Akka PubSub](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/distributed-pub-sub.html) for the synchronization of state between our masters, because
  - we need point-to-point communication to specific master actors
  - it hides the location of the actor in the cluster
  - we would need to encode the location of our node in the ring into the channel-name

## Presentation
