## Naming convention

- For nodes in a cluster, we will use the following names:
  - **Leader** for the node with the `leader` role (only one)
  - **Follower** for nodes with the `follower` role (many)
- For distributing work across actors in our algorithm implementation,
  independent from their location in the cluster,
  we talk about
  - the **Master** actor and
  - **Worker** actors

## Implementation status

- different options of storing results:
  - `ResultCollector` actors are all identical
    - if node is Leader they write to disk
    - else forward to `ResultCollector` on Leader
  - cluster singleton `ResultWriter` used by all `ResultCollector`s
    - FTP or local files?
    - `ResultCollector`s act as proxy for exactly-once messaging to `ResultWriter`
    - expect acknowledgement for received messages?
      ![ClusterSingleton architecture](../pictures/result-collector-ClusterSingleton.jpg)
  - `ResultCollector`s broadcast found ODs to each other
    - each one writes to own file
    - how to make sure all nodes receive message?
    - use akkaRouter?
- Use traits for the implementation of algorithmic tasks 
- Use queue to store OD candidates in master actor
  - different queue for in-progress candidates
